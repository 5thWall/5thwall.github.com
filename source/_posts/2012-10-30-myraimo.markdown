My roommate is an aspiring author, and so he's participating in
[NaNoWriMo][nano] this year. I've never been very good at NaNoWriMo, and I
wasn't planning on participating this year. On the other hand, have been meaning
to get started on another project, and I have an idea left over from my
[RailsRumble][rr] brainstorming session. So this year I've decided I'm going to
do my own personal MyRaiMo.

NaNoWriMo is a fairly rules light affair, and so I'm going to keep it that way
for me as well. I'm going to complete as much as I can between November 1st and
30th, but before that (so, tomorrow) I'm only allowing myself to:

 1. Generate a new rails project (because honestly, the computers going to do
    that for me anyway)
 2. Edit the readme
 3. Make issues in Github

Once MyRaiMo starts I'm going to try to keep it as close to the RailsRumble
rules as possible. Which means I'll be making or finding my own graphics and
doing all design by myself. Design hasn't really ever been one of my strong
suits, though I don't think I'm terrible at it.

I think this will be an all around interesting experience.
