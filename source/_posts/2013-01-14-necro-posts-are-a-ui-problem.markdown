Anyone who has been a regular visitor of an Internet forum is no doubt familiar with (or at least aware of) the problem of necro-posts. For those unfamiliar with the term, a "necro-post" is when a user responds to a very old thread without significantly adding to the conversation. In many forums, this will bump the thread up to the front page. This can be annoying because it drives down more recent conversations, without making the old conversation relevant again.

How do forums typically deal with this? Some responses are primarily driven by other users, such as downvoting or berating the necro-poster in subsequent posts (which, ironically, serves to keep the old thread alive and still doesn't significantly add to the conversation). Other responses are admin/mod-driven, like temporary bans or locking the thread in question. In all cases, the solution revolves around punishing the necro-poster. My primary problem with these solutions is that they are social solutions to a technical problem.

## Necro-Posts are a User Interface Problem

While this seems obvious to me, whenever I bring it up I get a lot of backlash.

> "Isn't it just good netiquette to check the date before you post something?"
> "Locking old threads isn't practical."
> "How hard is it to just read a date?"

So, I decided to make this blog post in an effort to explain my position by answering some of the common responses to it.
