I'm currently visiting San Francisco for the [HTML5 Developers Conference][H5DC], and decided to post my notes for today. I attended a handfull of talks, but only took notes in five of them, but I'll try to sumerize my thoughts on the others. The two best of the day were Web Components Revolution, and Federated and Free.
