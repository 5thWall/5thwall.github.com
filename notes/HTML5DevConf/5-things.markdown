Why it matters...
-------------------

Attractive Things Work Better (at least in people's perceptions).

1 Know that: You're Not a Designer
----------------------------------------

But you are awesome and can fake it.

2 Know how to: Lead The Eye
----------------------------------

Break down pages in terms of "reads". What should be read first. Use contrast, color, etc, size, etc.

Golden Ratio 1.618

Sharp angles lead eyes outside of the rectangle. Rounded corners keep your eyes in.

3 Know how to: Use Color & Imagery
-------------------------------------------

Know how to: Use Text & Typography
-------------------------------------------
* Chose a font that fits the subject.
* Don't use more than three

[TypeKit][tk]

Serif for heading, san-serif for text?

Find fonts that go together, x-height.

Increase line-height to make page look more elegant.
