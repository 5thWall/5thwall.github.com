When you're using the cloud, plan for failure.

Welcome to Cloud City?
---------------------------

Who owns your data? Maybe not you.

Can your data be exported in an open format?

### Terms of Service

* No negotiation
* Can change at any moment
* You may be banned without warning

Who Brokers your Identity?
-------------------------------

* Your email?
* Google / Apple?
* Your phone company?
* Credit Agencies / your SSN?
* Facebook / LinkedIn / Twitter (You're the product)?
* github

Open Protocol for Decentralized  Identity on the Web
------------------------------------------------------------

### Identity Standards

* OpenID
* OAuth
* OAuth2
* BrowserID / Persona

Open Protocols, but currently access control is still generally centralized

What is our switching cost?
--------------------------------

Stockholm Syndrome about our current options.

As a consumer, seek out utilities that specialize in serving my interests.

* Cell phone contracts
* Does your ISP prioritize their own video streaming solution over other data sharing the same wire?
* Businesses that develop and adopt standards, focus on building communities.

#### Example: App.net

* Your are the customer
* Incentive profit that is well aligned to the interests of their customers
* Is advertising a valid form of monetization? (opt-in? personalized?)
* Can I host my own? Is there lock-in?
* Is it a walled garden?
* Will it ever reach critical mass?
  * If it does, will it become too big to fail?
* Platform and product are still tightly coupled.

OpenShift Online from RedHat

Open Source The Cloud
---------------------------

1. OS - liberated!
2. Infrastructure - liberated! (OpenStack, RDO)
3. Platform - liberated! (OpenShift, CloudFoundary)
4. Integrate with OpenStack or other open systems to use your existing identity, authentication, authorization services.

### Establishing a Protocol
* tent.io
* pump.io
* OwnCloud
* Tahoe-LAFS

### Other Formats / Standards / Projects to keep an eye on

* RSS 3.0
* Activity Streams 3.0
* GNU Social

Crypto
-------

* Disk encryption
* File encryption
* Network i/o encryption

Who controls the lines of transmission?

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption

* Support for blind processing operations
* Data stays encrypted while being transacted upon

CryptoParty
