Hello, my name is Andy, and this is my blog. Well, the third or fourth iteration of my blog anyway. Getting these things started is easy, keeping them going is another mater all together. I intend to keep this blog as mostly about technology my pursuit of the craft of coding, but I can't guarantee that I won't also slip in the occasional post about philosophy/politics/religion/etc.
